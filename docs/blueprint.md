## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust, professionalism, and expertise. This choice references the intellectual nature of the services.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F2F5). It provides a clean and modern backdrop that is easy on the eyes.
- Accent color: Sky Blue, slightly more saturated than the primary to draw attention to key elements. This color remains harmonious while serving to emphasize calls to action and important information.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines; Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body. 'Space Grotesk' provides a modern, almost scientific aesthetic that complements 'Inter', ensuring legibility in long texts.
- Use a set of professional, modern icons to represent each service offered. Icons should be simple, geometric, and align with the overall style.
- Single-page layout with clear sections for each service, client testimonials, and contact information. Use white space effectively to avoid clutter.
- Subtle transitions and animations on scroll to engage users without being distracting.
